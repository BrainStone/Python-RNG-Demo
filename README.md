# Python-RNG-Demo

A little demo that demonstrates that insecure RNGs seeded with predictable values are easily broken.

## Disclaimers

This project explores how you can quickly make a super breakable RNG, that if you use it for anything serious like a
lottery (which will be the example used here) you can find yourself having it broken.
